# Custom-Document-Cropper
This sample repo uses multiple advanced android technologies and maths to create a document cropper. 

The work is still in progress and so far only camera has been implemented. Going onwards, we will be implementing image editing and finally push this off as a library. 

The camera implemented is an advanced camera that supports multiple features such as auto focus, focus on tap, highlighting the focused area, zoom upto 10x, fron/rear camera support, flash on/off.

In future this sample will also support image cropping, editing and other features using canvas and other tools necessary. 

Any suggestions to improvement is highly welcomed and I support active contribution to this repo to make this camera a better functioning open source option.
